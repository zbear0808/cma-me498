Ubuntu terminal notes

cd ..  			# move up one directory in tree)
cd. 			# stays in same directory in tree) idk what the purpose of this is

cd /mnt/c		# cd windows system instead of linux)
mkdir FolderName 	# makes directory
mkdir -p fx/gx/hx 	# Recursively makes directories inside of eachovther. 

rmdir MyFolderName 	#removes directory
rmdir -p fx/gx/hx	# recursively remove directories
# caveat: only does it if the dir is empty

tree -d #shows directories

touch file.txt		# creates empty dummy text file in cd

rm -r fx 		# deletes fx folder and everything in it

cat "textFile.txt" 	# concactenates and prints text file

head "textFile.txt" 	# concactenates and displays first line of text
tail "textFile.txt" 	# last line of text

mv "oldFile" "newFile"	# Cuts and pastes files to locations can also be used to rename

cp "oldFile" "newFile"	# Copy and pastes files to locations  (can use ./ to copy to up a directory)
cp */*.extension myDir 	# Copies all files of a certain extension to myDir


python3 example.py > temptext.txt # instead of printing output to the tirminal puts output into text file


PYTHON3

>>> b = "str"
>>> a = {(b):"yes"}
